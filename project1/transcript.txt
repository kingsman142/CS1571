===== test_aggregation1.config =====
You gave us a bad file and I couldn't tell whether or not you intentionally forgot a ',' on the second line.
If you did it intentionally, good job.  Every one of my test cases on the original file you gave us is:

python puzzlesolver.py test_aggregation1.config bfs
There was an error parsing the input!

python puzzlesolver.py test_aggregation1.config iddfs
There was an error parsing the input!

python puzzlesolver.py test_aggregation1.config unicost
There was an error parsing the input!

python puzzlesolver.py test_aggregation1.config greedy
There was an error parsing the input!

python puzzlesolver.py test_aggregation1.config astar
There was an error parsing the input!

However, if you didn't mean to make that mistake, I went ahead and fixed it.  I just wanted to make sure
I am giving you all the results and explaining the situation at hand; I don't want to lose points on this
exhausting project because of a dumb mistake.  So after fixing the mistake in the file, my output for the algorithms are the same as 'aggregation.config' above.
